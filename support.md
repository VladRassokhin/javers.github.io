##  Free support

JaVers is free, open source software and works great.
We strive to make it robust and easy to use.

1\. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javers) &mdash; 
great place for JaVers users to ask for help and to share knowledge with the community.
Most answers are written by the JaVers core team. 
 
2\. [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/javers/javers) &mdash;
conversations about JaVers internals and design.
For our contributors who work directly on enhancing JaVers itself. 

3\. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/javers_org) &mdash; announcements of new JaVers releases. 

If you like JaVers, give us a [star](https://github.com/javers/javers).

## Paid professional support

There are cases when Stackoverflow is not enough.

**2\. Buy a feature**

New features in JaVers are driven by our users needs.
Usually we deliver one or two new features per month.
But as you can see at [Github issues](https://github.com/javers/javers/issues),
the backlog is growing.

You can skip the queue and buy the super fast release (days instead of months).
The feature will be implemented in the next JaVers release.
